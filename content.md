## DeML OS

**Decentralized Machine Learning Operating System**

### Home

We focus on a core question at the intersection of Web3 and AI:

**Can ML be executed, verified, settled, and constrained without a central platform?**

**In Scope**

* ML execution under non-centralized scheduling
* Trust and correctness of ML in untrusted environments
* Native pricing and settlement mechanisms that support long-term operation

**Out of Scope**

* Systems that only change payment methods without changing ML execution
* Pure CPU / GPU compute marketplaces
* AI products or agent applications

### Projects

This section provides a structured overview of systems related to DeML OS.
The goal is comparison, not promotion.

Each project is evaluated along consistent system-level dimensions, including:

* Project details (like social links and white paper and so on)
* Supported ML task types (inference, training)
* Output semantics (deterministic or probabilistic)
* Verification mechanisms and trust model with known risks
* Pricing model and whether the system is subsidized
* Node/worker participation for ML task
* Governance and upgradeability
* Tokenomics

**Metrics**

* Worker number
* Historic task number
* Task price (inference, training, verification overhead)

Each project has a dedicated detail page with structured system information while have a list page to compare them in a condense table.

Initialized Projects:
- Gensyn
- Bittensor
- 0g
- Sentient
- Akash Network
- Livepeer
- Fluence
- Autonolas

### Research Notes

Research Notes track developments that may change how decentralized machine learning systems are built and understood.

* Notes are displayed by month
* The homepage shows the 5 most recent entries
* Each note includes:

  * Date
  * Source type (paper, blog, release, discussion)
  * Summary
  * Related capability tags (execution, verification, governance, incentive, application, hardware, blockchain, interface)
  * Related projects (if applicable)

The purpose is to maintain a high-signal, system-level research log.

### About Us

DeML OS is an open, research-oriented effort to define the system layer for decentralized machine learning.
We are not building a single product. We are working on shared abstractions, evaluation frameworks, and system understanding.
